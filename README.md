## sample1 <a name="sample1"></a>
This file will run samples to perform 
- Plotting Data
- Conputing Cost and Gradient descent
- Visualizing J(theta_0, theta_1)

For a given set of points we first plot the data points and then find a linear regression that minimizes the sum of the squares of distances (cost: least square) of the points from the line, using gradient descent. Then we will visulalize the cost function J.

<img src="sample1_fig1.jpg" width="600" alt="Data points and the line of regression" align="middle">

Here is the cost as a function of y-intercept (theta_0) and the slope (theta_1) of the line:

And the contour lines with the minimum value found:

## sample1_multi <a name="sample1_multi"></a>
This file will run samples to perform 
- Feature Normalization
- Gradient Descent
- Normal Equations

Here we load a set of data of some features of houses and their prices. First, we will scale the features to normalize them, then run a gradient descent to minimize the cost function. And eventually compute the regression line directly to compare. At the end you can see the estimate for price of a house not in the data set.

Here you can see the cost vs. number of iterations. This is good way to check if our code is working correctly:

## sample2 <a name="sample2"></a>
This file will run samples to perform logistic regression. It includes:
- Plotting Data
- Compute Cost and Gradient
- Optimizing using fminunc
- Predict and Accuracies

Here we have data on students being admitted to a program and two test scores. We predict the probability that a student with some scores will get admitted or not. 

Here you can see the test scores and whether a student is admitted or not. Then, we have found a "cut-off line" and based or predicctions on which side of the line a new student will fall, based on their test scores. 

<img src="sample2_fig1.jpg" width="600" alt="Cost vs. Number of iterations" align="middle">

Then we predict for a student with scores 45 and 85, an admission probability of 0.776291, with train accuracy: 89%.

## sample2_reg <a name="sample2_reg"></a>
This file will run samples to perform logistic regression with regularization. It includes:

## sample5 <a name="sample5"></a>
Here we fit a polynomial model to our data. This includes:
- Visualizing Data
- Regularized Linear Regression Cost
- Regularized Linear Regression Gradient
- Learning Curve for Linear Regression
- Feature Mapping for Polynomial Regression
- Learning Curve for Polynomial Regression
- Validation for Selecting Lambda

In this sample we analyse the bias and variance of our model. We start with a dataset of amount of waterflow out of a dam vs. the change in water levels. First step is to fit a line to the data, and of course it is not a good fit:

<img src="sample5_fig1.jpg" width="600" alt="fitting a line to dam data" align="middle"> 

Then we implement a polynomial model and using validation curves check whether increasing number of examples will make our model better.

<img src="sample5_fig2.jpg" width="600" alt="learning curve for linear regression" align="middle"> 

Next, we fit a polynomial to the data with regularization parameter lambda = 0:

<img src="sample5_fig3.jpg" width="600" alt="polynomial fit" align="middle"> 

And analyse the bias/variance again using the learning curve:

<img src="sample5_fig4.jpg" width="600" alt="bias/variance analysis on the learning curve" align="middle"> 

Finally, we vary the lambda and check the training error and the cross validation error to choose the best lambda:

<img src="sample5_fig5.jpg" width="600" alt="cross validation and traning errors" align="middle"> 

In this figure, we can see that the best value of lambda is around 3.

## sample6 <a name="sample6"></a>
We use support vector machines(SVMs) with various 2D datasets. We will demonstrate how to use a Gaussian
kernel with SVMs. This includes:
- Visualizing Data
- Training Linear SVM 
- Implementing Gaussian Kernel
- Training SVM with RBF Kernel

The first dataset is 2 dimensional and can be separated by a linear boundary.

<img src="sample6_fig1.jpg" width="600" alt="linear boundary with SVM" align="middle"> 

In this dataset, the positions of the positive examples (indicated with +) and the negative examples (indicated with o) suggest a natural separation indicated by the gap. However, there is an outlier positive example + on the far left at about (0:1; 4:1). We use a parameter C for the SVM in this code. Informally, the C parameter is a positive value that controls the penalty for misclassified training examples. A large C parameter tells the SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly. C plays a role similar to 1/lambda, where lambda is the regularization parameter that we were using for logistic regression. The figure above is with C = 1. A larger C will find a more skewed line that puts all the positive examples on one side of the line.

Next, we use SVMs to do non-linear classification. In particular, we use SVMs with Gaussian kernels on datasets that are not linearly separable.

<img src="sample6_fig2.jpg" width="600" alt="non-linear boundary with SVM" align="middle"> 

Gaussian kernel are a similarity function that measures the distance between a pair of examples, x(i) and x(j). The Gaussian kernel is also parameterized by a bandwidth parameter, sigma, which determines how fast the similarity metric decreases (to 0) as the examples are further apart. The Gassian Kernel is defined as

<img src="sample6_fig3.jpg" width="600" alt="Gaussian Kernel" align="middle"> 

Finally, we use the cross validation set to determine the best C and sigma parameter to use to find a non-linear boundary. The best result is shown here:

## sample6_spam <a name="sample6_spam"></a>
Here we will use the support vector machines created above to build a spam classifier. We first convert each
email into a feature vector x in R^n. This includes:
- Email Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Training Linear SVM for Spam Classification
- Testing Spam Classification
- Identifying top Predictors of Spam (check this out in the output, below)
- Trying our Own Emails

The method employed here in processing emails is to normalize dollar values and URLs, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we replace each URL in the email with the unique string `httpaddr` to indicate that a URL was present. This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small.

The code `processEmail.m` does the following preprocessings:
- Lower-casing
- Stripping HTML
- Normalizing URLs
- Normalizing Email Addresses
- Normalizing Numbers
- Normalizing Dollars
- Word Stemming
- Removal of non-words

Here is the output:

## sample7 <a name="sample7"></a> 
In this sample we implement k-means clustering and then use it to compress an image. This includes:
- Find Closest Centroids
- Compute Means
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Means Clustering on Pixels
- Image Compression

First we use a set of 2D points to test out our k-means clustering algorithm. Here we can see the results step-by-step (only 10 steps are shown):

Then we use the algorithm to cluster pixels in a photo that have RGB values close to each other, and use that clustering to compress the image. Here is the result:

## sample7_pca <a name="sample7-pca"></a>
In this sample we first use the Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimension of data. Then we will use it on an image to reduce its size. This includes:
- Visualizing Dataset
- Principal Component Analysis
- Dimension Reduction
- Visualizing Face Data
- PCA on Face Data: Eigenfaces
- Dimension Reduction for Faces
- Visualization of Faces after PCA Dimension Reduction
- PCA for Visualization

We first start with a 2D dataset, and plot its two eigenvectors at their mean. The longer eigenvector shows most of the data is in that direction, so to reduce the dimensionality, we can ignore the direction of the shorter one:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig1.jpg" width="600" alt="eigenvectors of 2D data" align="middle"> 
 
This can be achieved by projecting the points onto the longer eigenvector:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig2.jpg" width="600" alt="Projection of the data" align="middle">

Now this technique can be used to reduce dimension of pictures. For example, consider the following dataset of faces:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig3.jpg" width="600" alt="Some faces" align="middle">

We can compute the eigenvectors (eigenfaces!) of this dataset. Below the top 36 are shown:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig4.jpg" width="600" alt="Some faces" align="middle">

Now we can reduce the dimension of all of the faces in the above by projecting them onto these directions:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig5.jpg" width="600" alt="Some faces" align="middle">

Same method can be applied on any data set. For example the parrot in the previous sample. Here are all the RGB values of its pixels:

<img src="sample7_pca_fig6.jpg" width="600" alt="Some faces" align="middle">

We can reduce the image by projecting them into two dimensions:
